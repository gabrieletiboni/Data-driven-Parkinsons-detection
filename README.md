# Data-driven Parkinson's detection

Shallow machine learning techniques have been analysized and applied for a data-driven Parkinson's disease diagnosis from patient voice measurements. In particular, the mathematical aspects of the underlying methods have been presented and deeply discussed, together with a brief introduction of machine learning theory.
